          "content": "I’m a final year CS undergrad at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Jabalpur passionate about data science and machine learning research. My research interests include Machine Learning and Time series forecasting. . Currently, I’m interning as a Data Scientist @ NeenOpal, which is a global management consulting firm with a unique and specialized focus on Data Science based out in Banglore. . In the past, I’ve taken an interest in high performance deep learning on FPGA’s and statistical modeling for time series. During my undergraduation I designed a Neural Network accelerator on Intel CycloneV SoC FPGA using High Level Synthesis tools and languages. I also worked on forecasting project under Prof. Sunil Agrawal where I forecasted Onion arrival to Mumbai (a city in India) markets from farmers. . In the summer of 2019, I was a visiting researcher at HCI Lab, IIIT Allahabad working on early detection of Autism in toddlers using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I was fortunate enough to work under the amazing mentorship of Prof. Anupam Agrawal. . I actively publish code to GitHub. I’m also active on Twitter and LinkedIn. If you think me (or my projects) are interesting feel free to contact me! You can also mail me at jithendra1230@gmail.com. I’m always interested in hearing about new opportunities to collaborate and work on machine learning projects or hackathons. . I spend my time analysing some publicly available data, reading research papers and writing. I spend my liesure time mostly banging my head to some heavy metal and some times I read books. Unfortunately, 2020 compelled me to blog about my weird music taste. I started writing my personal thoughts and impressions on Metal bands and their albums on Medium. . “Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life as well. It’s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay?” – Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft. . Links: . Twitter | LinkedIn | GitHub | .",
